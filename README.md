# AsciiDoctor Podman Workflow System

This project assists you in making asciidoctor easier to use by:

 1.  building a functional container using rootless podman
 2.  enabling ascii2svg diagramming support
 3.  providing an easy to use Makefile that you can adapt to your
     needs
 4.  hopefully help us improve our own documentation

This idea stems from the original Dockerfile in the asciidoctor sources
years ago.
